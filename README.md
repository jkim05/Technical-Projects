### *Wolf Trap Foundation Project:*


AI Chatbot & Data Analytics Project (for Wolf Trap Foundation)

This capstone project involved leading a senior project team to develop and implement a scalable, conversational AI chatbot using Microsoft Azure services. The project also included a data analytics component to provide actionable insights from historical business data, showcasing end-to-end development and client management.

Key Functions & Goals:
- Conversational AI Development: Leveraged Azure's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings and key services to engineer a resilient, conversational AI solution that provides automated support.

Data Analytics & Business Intelligence: 
- Engineered and delivered interactive Power BI dashboards from geographic ticket sales data to inform future marketing campaigns and drive data-driven decision-making.

Project & Client Management: 
- Managed the project from end to end, coordinating team efforts and providing remote technical training to a key stakeholder to ensure the successful delivery and adoption of the solution.

Technologies Used:
- Microsoft Azure PaaS: Core cloud platform for hosting and scaling the conversational AI solution.

- Azure AI Bot Service: Main service for building, connecting, and managing the chatbot.

- Azure AI Language (LUIS): Utilized for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries.

- Azure Cognitive Services: Provided pre-built AI capabilities for intelligent features.

- Power BI: Used to create interactive dashboards and data visualizations for business intelligence.
