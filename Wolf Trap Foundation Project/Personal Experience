My Role & Contributions:
This project was a capstone for my senior year at George Mason University, completed with a team of five students. My duties evolved from a note-taker to a primary leader, and I was responsible for assembling our team, scheduling meetings, gathering documentation, and assigning tasks. I also directly supported each team member in their project responsibilities, which included:

- Azure AI Development: Assisting with the development of the chatbot.

- Power BI Learning: Aiding in the creation of the business intelligence dashboards.


Key Lessons & Outcomes:
Delegation & Team Management: I learned the critical importance of delegating tasks to ensure every team member had a meaningful contribution, which was vital for project success and team morale.

Conflict Resolution: I discovered that while team cohesion is important, it is not always required. I successfully separated team members working on different objectives to prevent further escalation and maintain project momentum.

Effective Communication: Clear communication and detailed meeting notes were essential for keeping the team on track and providing a valuable resource for members who were absent.

Technical Versatility: I had to learn new technologies in both Azure and Power BI to assist my team, a crucial lesson in the ability to wear multiple hats and provide quality assurance for the final deliverable.
